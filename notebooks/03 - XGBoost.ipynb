    "# XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosted Decision Trees)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next notebook will look at a popular library called `XGBoost`, which stands for \"Extreme Gradient Boosting\" and applies to CART.  With random forests, we take a large number of decision trees and agglomerate their answers.  XGBoost starts from the same premise:  create an ensemble of trees.  The key difference is that XGBoost uses a technique called \"boosting\" to correct the mistakes of prior iterations in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we build the first model off of training data and see how it does.  Then, the second model takes the first model's results as an input and tries to correct what the first model got wrong.  Then, the next third model tries to improve upon the second model, and so on until either all training predictions are correct or we have reached a maximum number of classifier models (i.e., a maximum number of iterations).\n",

    "The sklearn library has a method called `train_test_split` which breaks our data out into training and test datasets.  This allows us to train a model on one set of data and then see how it would perform on a completely different set of data.  This gives us a better idea of how our model might perform than simply using accuracy from the test dataset, as models tend to **overfit**:  they latch on the peculiarities of the training dataset.  If those peculiarities do not also exist in the broader population, then the trained model may come up with the wrong answer.  Having a separate test dataset that the trained model knows nothing about gives us a better idea of realistic behavior.  It also allows us to come up with a measure of how much overfitting the trained model does, as we can compare the training accuracy to the test accuracy; if there is a substantial difference between the two, our model is overfitting quite a bit."
