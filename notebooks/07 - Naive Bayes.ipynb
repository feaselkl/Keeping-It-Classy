I like this classifier a lot because it's a fast, simple classifier which does reasonably well on datasets.  You can usually do better than Naive Bayes with a tailor-made model, but for something quick and dirty to see if you meet a minimum baseline for a go/no-go decision, it does well."

For example, `gender` has two values, M and F.  Ordinal encoding will set one of these to 0 and the other to 1.  We need to do this for each of the non-numeric features."
