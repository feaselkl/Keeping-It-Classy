    "Before we can feed this data into the Passive-Aggressive Classifier algorithm (or pretty much any other classification algorithm), we need to convert any text data into numeric data.  There are a few common techniques for encoding.  The technique we will use for our dataset is called one-hot encoding.  What it does is \"pivot\" the categorical data, so that each distinct categorical value gets its own feature.  For example, `gender` has two values, M and F.  One-hot encoding will create new new features, one for `gender=M` and one for `gender=F`.  We need to do this for each of the non-numeric features."
